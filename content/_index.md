# Kollektivtrafikens datalabb

Kollektivtrafikens Datalabb (KoDa) aims to collect, store, and provide a historical open data record of the real time and static data that is provided by in the Trafiklab.se open data service. The GTFS static and GTFS realtime data from many Swedish public transportation authoritiesâ€™ (PTAs) that currently delivered such are stored in a common database and becomes an open, annotated, dataset for both local and nationwide applications related to public transport. The KoDa dataset is envisioned to be the base for application areas within the public transport sector, but it can also be used in other sectors where other actors can create value by analysing public transport data. A platform for interacting with the dataset has been developed to enable users to work with data analysis and AI development using the KoDa public transport dataset as the base. Public transport is not only an independent business that has its challenges, it can also be seen as a sensor in traffic. The KoDa data can be used by external actors to get information on the current and historical traffic flows of a city and thereby be able to monitor effects of changes made to the traffic environment. Accessibility and mobility are a challenge area where more actors need more and better tools to support the transition to a more mobile & sustainable society. The KoDa data- and toolset can be a used for the development of applications in that field.
